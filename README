CanHazBreakz
============

This plugin adds a way to throttle ActiveRecord creation.

Add +can_haz_breakz+ to your model to enable the throttling.
It will then not be possible to create models in quick succession.

An error message will be added to the base object and the object
will not be valid. The error message can be localized using the
key +can_haz_breakz.break+ with {{count}} as the timeout in seconds.


Options
=======

+timeout+: the time to wait between creates, in seconds. Default is 6.


Prerequisites
=============

Your model needs to have a created_at column for this to work.


Installation
============

ruby script/plugin install git://github.com/tilsammans/can_haz_breakz


Examples
========

class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
  can_haz_breakz
end

class Tweet < ActiveRecord::Base
  can_haz_breakz :timeout => 2
end
