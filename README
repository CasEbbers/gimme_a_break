CanHazBreakz
============

This plugin adds a way to throttle ActiveRecord creation.

Add +can_haz_breakz+ to your model to enable the throttling.
It will then not be possible to create models in quick succession.

A error message will be added to the base object and the object
will not be valid. The error message can be localized using the
key +can_haz_breakz.break+ with {{count}} as the timeout in seconds.


Options
=======

+timeout+: the time to wait between creates, in seconds.


Installation
============

ruby script/plugin install git://github.com/tilsammans/can_haz_breakz


Examples
========

class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
  can_haz_breakz
end

class Tweet < ActiveRecord::Base
  can_haz_breakz :timeout => 2
end
